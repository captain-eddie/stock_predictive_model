1.  Identify the stock or index for which you want to predict the price.

2.  Collect historical stock prices data for the selected stock or index from a reliable source. Websites like Yahoo Finance or FRED can be used to download the data.

6.  Document your work, keep track of the steps you took during the data collection process, including any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.
